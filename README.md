# Full Stack Node/React GraphQL Practice

This is a personal project I'm working on in my spare time. I have a rough idea of having a
React frontend that consumes a basic API in order to track the progress of my job search 
and provide an area to view stats.

I'm mostly interested in learning about using GraphQL and in building a full stack 
Javascript application. I've built separate back- and front- ends using Node and React
but never both for the same app!
